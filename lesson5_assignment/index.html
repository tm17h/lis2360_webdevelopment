        <h2> <em>Overview</em></h2>
        
        <p> <em>Florida State University is a public college located in the capital of Florida.</em>  Tallahassee, Florida is full of rich history and tradition dating back to 1821.  Along with the history the wonderfull city possess, Tallahassee is home to one of the most well known colleges in the United States.</p>
        
        <p> Florida State University is home to about 35,000 students from all across the country. FSU has many different degree fields, clubs, sporting teams, etc.  There are plenty of ways for students to get connected and interact with others around campus. Our university does a tremendous job of hosting career events for upperclassmen to have a chance to apply for internships and even obtain jobs.  Occasionally, their will be social events held on Landis Green that allows students to come play volleyball, cornhole, and enjoy some food and drinks with their fellow students.  </p>
        
        <p> This wonderfull city is also very well known for having a good time.  Students have plenty of options when deciding what to do with their nights, whether its going to Greek life events or heading to the popular bars and clubs, there are always options.  College Town is located right next to campus and is the most popular spot for our students.  College Town has 4 popular restaurants that our students love: Madison Social, Township, Centrale Pizza, and Tin Lizzies.  The weekends in the fall are never a disapointment because FSU is a huge football school and the students and our awesome fans all make their ways to Doak Campbell Stadium on Saturdays to watch our Seminoles play.  </p>
